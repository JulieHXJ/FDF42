# FDF42

Project breakdown
1. File Parsing:
Parse the .fdf file to extract the 3D points (x, y, z).
Use get_next_line and ft_split from your libft to read the file and split data efficiently.

2. Data Representation:\n
Represent the map using a structure like t_map, which will store the grid of 3D points and metadata (e.g., dimensions).

3. Projection:\n
Use an isometric projection to convert the 3D points into 2D coordinates for rendering.

4. draw the 2D map:\n
Use bresenham algorithm to draw the line between the converted points.

5. Rendering:
Use MiniLibX or MLX42 to render the wireframe model in a window.
Implement smooth window management (e.g., ESC to quit, cross to close).

6. User Interaction:
Allow basic interactions like zoom, rotation, and translation of the map.
Add controls for switching projections or adjusting parameters.

# Resources
isometric projection formula:
x = (x - y) * cos(30);
y = (x + y) * sin(30) - z;

draw line algorithm:
https://youtu.be/RGB-wlatStc?si=jZuOaV4Hl028tf3a This video will explain the idea of Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm and the math behind it. but it only explains one very specific case, which is when the slope is less 1 and the values of x and y need to be incremented.
